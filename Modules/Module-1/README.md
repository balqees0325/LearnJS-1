In this module you'll make a start into wonderful world of programming. We will be using the programming language `JavaScript` to do so. You'll learn about the basic building blocks of programming: `loops`, `functions`, `control flow` and more. Consider these as the ABC's of programming, without them it's impossible to write working software!

You'll be learning two main things:

1. Fundamental concepts in programming
   While we're using JavaScript to illustrate these concepts, it's important to keep in mind that what you will learn is applicable to **any** programming language. They might differ in syntax (a fancy term for the arrangement of words in a language in order for it to make sense), but the functionality will be the same: a loop will always be a loop.

   This should be your mindset when you're learning concepts: **I'm learning how to become a software developer that can adjust to any language used, because I know what the underlying principles and concepts are**.

2. How to think like a programmer
   In one sentence this means: **knowing how to solve problems computationally**. Let's split that up in two parts: `how to solve problems` refers to the ability to identify issues and find effective solutions. `computationally` refers to the ability to think in logical steps that the computer can understand and execute.

   This should be your mindset when you're learning how to think : **I'm learning how to think in logical steps, identifying cause and effect, and always looking for solutions**.

## Before you start!

In order to test your JavaScript code, you'll be using software that will execute your files from the command line. This software is called [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Download the Long-Term Support (LTS) version for your specific operating system.

- For Windows, click [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.0/node-v10.16.0-x64.msi)
- For Mac, click [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.0/node-v10.16.0.pkg)
- For Linux, click [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.0/node-v10.16.0-linux-x64.tar.xz)

After you've installed it, go to your command line interface. Type in the following command:

```
node --version
```

It should show you version `v10.14.2` or higher.

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Have an idea of what computer programming is
- Know the basic buildingblocks of JavaScript
- Correctly write and use variables, functions and loops
- Understand the control flow
- Think like a programmer

## How to use this repository

This repository consists of 3 parts:

1. `Reading materials`: this document contains all the required theory you need to know _**while**_ you're coding. It's meant as both study material and as a reference to understand what you're doing.
2. `Homework`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework.
3. `Lesson Plans`: this part is meant for teachers as a reference. However, as a student don't be shy to take a look at it as well!

After your first class you should start with checking the `reading materials` for that week. So, for the first time that is the [Week 1 Reading](/Modules/Reading-1/README.md). Study all the concepts and try to get the gist of everything. After, you can get started with the `homework` for that week.

Here is the Homework [Week 1](/Modules/Homework/README.md)
